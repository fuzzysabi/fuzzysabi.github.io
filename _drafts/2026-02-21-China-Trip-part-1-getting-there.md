Jume 2025: K got a scholarship to travel China, so of course I went along! After
months of back and forth regarding passports, visas, and scheduling, we were
finally off with our excited ariport selfie:

Such a small plane for the first flight, but it was K's first flight anywhere:

30 hours later, after layovers in Seattle and Seoul, we finally made it through
customs and out into the humid night of ChangSha. Our first impression of China
was wonderful, as we were thirsty and attempting to manage the AliPay app to use
a vending machine when a nice guy showed us how it works, and bought us water
(I'm sure we looked rather haggard). Thinking it was only a few blocks to the
hotel, we decided to walk.  It turned out to be an interesting choice, as we had
to cross 3 highways with nearly no crosswalks.

The first rather startling discovery whas when the lights turned off for us in
the hotel.  We'd been in for about a minute, and had just walked over to the far
side of the room when all went dark.  ?! Thinking I had done something that
activated a timer, I felt my way back to the door to let in some light. Tapping
the card to the light switch, all the lights turned back on. I closed the door
and walked away when it happened again! This time I knew it had to be part of
that switch.  Looking closer, there was a slot in what I had originally assumed
to be an rfid switch. Leaving the card in that allowed us to use the power as
usual. Turns out the power to the room is cut when the card is removed for more
than about a minute, and this is standard everywhere we went
