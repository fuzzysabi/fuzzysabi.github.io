So, the other day I was finally installing the trim around the windows, when the drywall rasp I was using slipped out of my hand and fell to the floor. For a construction-grade tool, this wouldn't have been a problem. However, for this particular sloppy chunk of yak dung, the plastic screw which holds the blade in snapped in half. While Stanley has a great warranty, I would in fact have been stuck with a shiny new piece of said dung, and that's just unacceptable. So, I rage-fixed it.

First, I grabbed a piece of scrap hardwood, a bolt, and a matching threaded insert.



Drill out the hole, and mark the appropriate shape



Plane the front angle


Insert the threaded...er...insert


Chisel the angle for the blade hook

Test fit and file accordingly

Too high, file a bit more

Perfect. Rage-fix time: 15 minutes. Less time than going back to the store.
