- Introduction -
(January 2006)

     If you've ever tried to write a serious paper or book, you know how hard it is to find the right thing to say to get it started. Well, the sentence you just read was mine, and believe me it has taken me a long time to figure it out! 
     Most of the books people write start with something that happens at the beginning of the story and proceed from there. Or, they tell you 'part'' of the end of the story and then 'flash back'' to the beginning and 'fill in the blanks'  all the way to the end. The problem I have been having is that mine doesn't start at the beginning or the end,... it starts in the middle! I know what you're thinking; 'How can a book start in the middle?" The reason this book is starting in the middle can be summed up in one phrase. Unfortunately, you may not understand the 'phrase' until you've read the book. It goes like this:

'There are times when we are young that we think we know some great truth.
Yet, when we grow older, we find out that what we thought was true was not correct.
In the same way, there are things when we are young, that we believe God is leading us to do a certain task, but we do not understand why until we have grown older, and can look back in time and finally understand why God led us in the path only He could see.'

     May God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, bless you and increase your understanding of Himself, as you proceed through the pages before.    
Sincerely In Christ,
Dan Conley
