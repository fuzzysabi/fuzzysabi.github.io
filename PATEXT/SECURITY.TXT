" There were twelve of the apostles
On that bitter, storm-tossed sea.
But only one was able there
To challenge you and me.

"Peter walked upon the water
Til he touched the Saviour's hand.
But where were the eleven
Other ones in Jesus band?

"Where was James, and where was Thomas,
Watching Peter's stumbling feet?
They were grasping their security
On a fragile storm-tossed seat.

"There came a day that gallant ship
Lay sinking hopelessly
Then someone cried, "Save us, Lord"
and cried it lustily.

"Yes, all of us must meet Him,
in the ship, or on the sea,
So why not walk the water,
Where the wind blows free?
