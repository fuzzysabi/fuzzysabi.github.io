-Geneology from Adam to Noah-

  Adam - three sons: Cain, Abel (killed by his brother Cain.) Seth - born after the death   
               of  Abel and the banishment of Cain. Other sons and dauthers were born to 
               Adam but their names are not recorded in Scripture. (see Gen. 5:3-5)
               Adam was 130 yrs. old when Seth was born.("years old"may be misleading. 
               Because we do not know how long Adam existed in a perfect earth that was 
               without death prior to their eating of the forbidden fruit from the tree of the 
               knowledge of good and evil, it is possible that the "counting of years" of 
              Adams life began at the "fall" rather than when God first created Adam.)

     It should be noted that if these figures are even close to being correct, they present some interesting conclusions. First, we know that Noah lived 350 years after the landing of the Ark on Mt Ararat. According to the time of Abrams' birth, Noah would still be alive at an age of  893 years old. He would live for another 57 years. Noah's son Shem was 98 years old when the Ark landed on Mt. Ararat. He lived 502 years after the landing of the Ark. By these figures Shem would have been 390 years old when Abram was born. He would have lived for another 210 years making it possible for him to have known about Abrams' children as far down as the sons of Jacob.
    More importantly, this shows that the record of Gen. 1, and of the flood could have easily been passed down through these generations by people who had primary knowledge of the events. There would have been a signifcant number of people who would have had secondary knowledge as well, making the information extremely accurate and reliable.
   At this point in the geneology, however, we have a large gap in time between the death of Joseph and the birth of Moses. We do know that it was a long enough period of time so that the new king of Egypt did not know about Joseph. (Ex.1:8), and enslaved the children of Isreal for some 400 years. At which time Moses leads them out of Egypt.


     Through Archeology the date of the exodus from Egypt has been determined to be 
1441 B.C.. This would put the birth of Moses at approximately 1520 B.C. and the beginning of the Isrealites captivity in Egypt at approximately 1840 B.C. (See  Archeology and The Old Testament, by Merrill F. Unger; Zondervan Publishing House, pages 119-139) Archeological finds have also determined that Abraham lived at about  c.2100B.C. The difference between the time of Abraham and the time of the captivity is 260 years. Looking back at the geneological chart on the previous page we can see that the combined number of years between the birth of Isaac and the death of Joseph could easily account for the 260 years in which the geneologies are missing.
