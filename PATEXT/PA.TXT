- Scriptural Concepts Related to Marriage - 
(or)
- The 'Pa Letters' -

    The 'Pa Letters' (as my family calls them) are a series of seven letters I wrote to my son and his fiancee, as premarital counselling. They are Biblical based concepts that are critical 
for those believers in Christ who want to maintain a
God centered marriage and family.
In the process of writing these letters, Brent Ewing, (of the Centennial E.V. Church,
here in Grangeville, Idaho) wrote several sermons that dovetailed
with the 'Pa Letters' so well, that I included them at the back of the appropriate letters.
This 'sameness of mind and spirit' was not planned on our part.
I sincerely believe that God had a great deal to do with it!
It is my hope and prayer that you find The 'Pa Letters' a help and encouragement.
Sincerely in Christ,
Dan Conley
'Pa'
