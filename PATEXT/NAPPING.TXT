- Caught Napping -
(Jan. 28, 2004)

     Several hours ago while I was taking a short nap, my thoughts went back to a conversation my wife and I had earlier that day. We were concerned about the coming years. We are both in our mid fifties, and we are both the youngest of our families. We know that in the next twenty years or more there will be many times of sorrow due to the deaths of our family members, friends and possbly even our own time of passing from this life.
     The thought of having to go through the coming years of sorrow was at best, depressing. I did not want to face the next twenty or more years of sadness and grief as loved ones passed away. I was deeply troubled by my own thoughts.
     Then, as if the Holy Spirit was helping and guiding my thoughts, I realized that there was no need to fear the future or be depressed over the passing of our family members when the time comes. The reason for this is because all of them, as far as we know, have received Christ as their Savior and therefore, will not be gone from us long. For we will meet them in Heaven with Christ at our appointed time. Also, they will be free from the corruption of these mortal bodies, sin and this fallen world. They will no longer have fear, doubt, hunger, sickness or physical pain. They will have peace with Christ.
     Yes, I will still miss them, but I think I  might envy them as well, for they will be whole with Christ! To those of you who may pass on before me, ... save me a seat! I'll be there in His time.
