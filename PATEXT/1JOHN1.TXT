- First John -
(Chapter 1:1-10)
N.A.S.V.

What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes,

what we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life -

and the life was manifested, and we have seen and bear witness and proclaim to you the eternal life 

which was with the Father and was manifested to us - what we have seen and heard we proclaim

to you also, that you also may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father, 

and with His Son Jesus Christ. And these things we write, so that our joy may be made complete.

And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light, and 

in Him there is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in 

the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth; but if we walk in the light as He Himself is in the 

light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanes us from all 

sin. If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth in not in us. If we 

confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all 

unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.
