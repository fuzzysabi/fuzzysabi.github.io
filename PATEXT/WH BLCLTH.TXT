- Why, Blue Collar Theology?-

     Okay! It's a fair question, and I guess it's about time I spilled the beans and told you folks what this is all about. The phrase, 'Blue Collar Theology', came about after a number of years of either reading theological books or, listening to people who had just read a book by a Dr. in Theology (or some thing else) that made no sense at all. Next, there have been those who have their doctorate in a field that in not even remotely related to Biblical Studies, that are trying to explain how the their particular area of science is the best way to explain the Bible. Also, in about the last twenty to thirty years (yes I am old enough to have a person knowledge of what I'm about to say.) there has been a sharp increase people who believe that it is better to get their information from someone who has a doctorate (and has written a book) in a particular area than someone who has 'hands on experience' in the same area, but does not have a 'PHD' in the area in question.
     This brings me to a point where I need to say that are people out there (where ever 'there' is) that are on the other side of the fence from what I have just been explaining.
