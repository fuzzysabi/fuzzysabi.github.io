- Creation  1A -
(Before the Beginning)

     In the studying of Creation, we often make the mistake of diving into the first verse of the first chapter of Genesis assuming that this is where everything "began". It is an easy error to make, but the truth is that there was something before Genesis 1:1 that needs to be understood before attempting to unravel the mysteries of creation.
     First, we must understand that before the foundations of the earth were put into place God (Elohim) existed along with Christ and the Holy Spirit. They are the three in one Godhead. They have existed in an infinite way, outside of time as we know it. Creation was a combined work of  God the Father (Gen.1:1), God the Son (Gen.1:3 "And God said,...", sigifying the Word of God. See John 1:1-5 for futher clarification.), and the Holy Spirit (Gen.1:2 "...And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.)
     Second, we must keep in mind that  
            
          The Bible begins with God, not with a philosophic argument for His existence. He is a fact, not an intellectual argument. The Hebrew word is "Elohim", it is the first of the names of Deity, it is a plural noun in form but is singular in meaning when it refers to the true God.
     The word "created" is meant as; "bringing into being from nothing". It is also defined as to be "spoken into existence" Hebrews 11:3 uses the same concept.
         "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God,
           so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear."
