title: Thermostat of DOOM!
---

I made a thermostat nearly a year ago using an arduino pro mini, an old usb
converter, a big relay, and a couple of sensors left over from work. it looks
like a [bomb][ahmed], which is awesome, and it's hard coded to around 55 degrees, which
is perfect for my shop. ![thermostat](/pictures/thermostat.jpg){:rotate(80deg)}

This has worked flawlessly for a long time now without any interaction from me
to keep my glue from freezing up and my fingers working even in the coldest of
situations. I will likely need to augment the relay this winter, as the heater
cannot keep up completely without a supplemental heater when the outside
temperature is below 0Â°F. I know, northern hemisphere first world problems, but
what can you do?



      //Thermostat, by fuzzy
      //turns on/off a relay based on a preset value.

      /*
      feature list:
      shrink existing code onto a attiny85
      set temp, maybe optical sensor
              will need readout
      use dual sensor for safety
      light sensor with two temps

      Thermistor test sketch, will return a value between 0 and 1024.
      Uses a 10k resistor at a0/gnd, in paralell with the thermistor at a0 and 5v.
      Can play with resistor values to create a good range within the target.
