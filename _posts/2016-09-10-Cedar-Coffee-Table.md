Check out this coffee table I made for my friend Cody: ![table][final]

It started out as cedar fence boards  which I got from the orange
store. ![cedar fence boards][boards]  

I hand planed them flat, and then edge joined the
top to be about 24" wide.  ![hand planed][planing] 
  
![edge joined][glue]

Here's a small sample of the natural stain, iron acetate made by dissolving fine steel wool in vinegar for a few days. It actually dyes the wood in an accelerated form of the same thing that happens when it's left out int he elements for a few years!  ![small sample][stain] 

The leg joints  were double dovetails, preventing side wobble in the table.![Leg joints][joint]

I cut a rabbet in some scrap ash for the apron clips and screwed them
in from the underside, creating a stable surface. ![apron clips][clips] 

Once all the joinery was done, my daughter helped stain and oil the
table, which turned out to be the perfect weathered color with the acetate
stain. ![complete][complete] 
 

Two coats of tung oil was enough to make the grain pop without adding too much
depth of finish. ![daughter][kaeli]
