Traditionally, wire harnesses are pulled on boards with nails in them. But what if you are doing rapid development? How do you pull a new wire harness design every time without wasting wood or time? You make a jig! A big one. Thread some holes into a sheet of plastic, and each design is easy, modular, and modifiable! Draw the layout in dry erase marker, and lengths can change without headache. That first hurdle, though:

To get evenly spaced holes every 2" apart, I taped off every other hole on a piece of pegboard and pilot drilled through the exposed holes. Not glamorous, not fast, but it worked. 1,081 holes for every operation: pilot, clearance, chamfer, install inserts. 4,324 individual operations done just once to save time, every time.
