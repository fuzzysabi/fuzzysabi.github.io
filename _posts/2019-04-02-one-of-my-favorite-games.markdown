Rings, or ringboard, is an old English pub dexterity game. The game consists of a series of 13 hooks arranged on a board, at which are thrown 6 rubber rings. First to a pre-set number (a nice round number between 50 and 500) wins.

This one I made has the family crest on it, we must have been fisherfolk back in Ireland somewhere because of the seashells.

I've made about 4 of these boards now, and I really love this game. Unfortunately the rings have very few suppliers, but can be ordered from [Masters Traditional Games](http://www.mastersgames.com/) in the UK. The board below I made for my dad last year, and since it was hard to wrap I just put a little bow on it.
