So, the other day I was finally installing the trim around the windows, when the drywall rasp I was using slipped out of my hand and fell to the floor. For a construction-grade tool, this wouldn't have been a problem. However, for this particular sloppy chunk of yak dung, the plastic screw which holds the blade in snapped in half. While Stanley has a great warranty, I would in fact have been stuck with a shiny new piece of said dung, and that's just unacceptable. So, I rage-fixed it.

First, I grabbed a piece of scrap hardwood, a bolt, and a matching threaded insert.

Drill out the hole, and mark the appropriate shape

Plane the front angle, insert the threaded...er...insert, chisel the angle for the blade hook and test fit and file accordingly

Perfect. Rage-fix time: 15 minutes. Less time than going back to the store.
