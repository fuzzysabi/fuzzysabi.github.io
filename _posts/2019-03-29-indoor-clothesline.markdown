Clotheslines are the bomb. I mean, just put your clothes on this medieval device, wait awhile, and your clothes are dry? Witchcraft! The best ones are outside, so the magic imbued in the sun and wind can work it's wonder on your clothes, but failing that there's still bound to be a bit of magic indoors, right? Enter my modular, low profile, "yacht's clothesline". OK, pretentiousness aside, I think it's a dang good idea to have some string you can attach to a couple of walls and prevent the damage of the dryer. Ever clean a lint trap? That's bits of your clothing that fell off in the machine.

Basically, this project is as simple as it gets. Put a couple of eye screws in two boards, and attach them on opposite walls. My contribution is small boat cleats under one side, allowing you to put up or tighten at your leisure without fussing about with too many knots.
