Yup, I switched the blog to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on github pages. With everything else going on in life, I figured it was best to not have another web-facing server to worry about keeping updated. There might be some theme updating on the way, but the content is mostly back. I finally got a ahng of using git to work with the files, so it's helping me code some. I will still ramble some, and post vacation pictures when time allows, but this way will be a little easier for me to keep it up.
